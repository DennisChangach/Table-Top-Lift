# **The Design and Fabrication of a Table-Top Elevator/Lift**


Presented as a course project for the unit _Microcontrollers, 4th Year, 2nd Semester, BSc. Mechatronic Engineering JKUAT_

## **Project Description**

The project involved the design, fabrication and prototyping of a 3 floor lift/elevator (floor 0,1 and 2). The lift was to be operated similar to how a fully-functional lift would ran. The project was meant to enable us appreciate and understand the wonderful world of product design that encompasses both mechanical, electronics and firmware engineering as well as how to design for usability.
